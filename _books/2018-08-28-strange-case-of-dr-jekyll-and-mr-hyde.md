Although the author shamelessly stole the name idea from [my favourite static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com), I liked the book and I'd love to meet him someday!

Here's a quote I thought was worth sharing:

> It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date... I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements.
