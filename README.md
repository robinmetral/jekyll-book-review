# jekyll-book-review

Book reviews for your Jekyll site, built for Minima ðŸ“š

## In brief

The purpose of this project is to **provide Jekyll users with a simple, hackable book reviews template**.

It consists in two HTML layouts:

 - `_layouts/books.html` displays a list of book reviews beloning to a custom [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)
 - `_layouts/review.html` displays an individual book review with the book's cover, either self-hosted or imported through the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers)

It was developed for Minima (the Jekyll default theme) and can be set up on a site running Minima in minutes, but it can also be easily adapted to any theme.

## Don't tell me, show me

Okay, here's [the demo](https://robinmetral.github.io/jekyll-book-review/) (on an out-of-the-box Jekyll site running Minima).
